# NodeBot

## Info
I started this bot as a little project for my friend's discord server and ended up building it out quite a bit. It was a lot of fun, but ultimately I lost motivation to continue working on it. It was fun, but now it remains sa stagnant code on github.

## Notable features
- Advanced command handler using schemas
- Economy system
- Levels
- Database connections for cross-server usage
- Per-server welcome-message
- Per-server prefix
